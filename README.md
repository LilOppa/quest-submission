## Chapter 1 Day 1

1. **Blockchain** - decentralized shared database where data stored in blocks and linked together via cryptography
2. **Smart-contract** - simply program stored on a blockchain that run when user interect with him
3. **Transaction** is changes the data on the Blockchain and need an exucation fee. **Script** is only reads data (doesn't change it) on the Blockchain and free

## Chapter 1 Day 2

1. Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming
2. 
- **Safety and Security** prevent hacking of smart-contracts and leakage of user funds.
- **Clarity** allows us to make sure that the smart-contract is secure developer has not added his malicious code there.
- **Approachability** The fact that Cadence is very similar to other programming languages makes it easy for many developers to go to Flow and start building.
- **Developer Experience** allows developers to quickly find bugs and fix them.

## Chapter 2 Day 2

1. A script cannot changes data, so we call "changeGreeting" function in a transaction (transaction is changes the data).
2. The "AuthAccount" type is used to access the data in your account.
3. The "prepare" phase is used to access the information/data in your account. The "Execute" phase can't do that, but it can call functions and do stuff to change the data on the blockchain.
