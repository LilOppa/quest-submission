## Chapter 1 Day 2

1. Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming
2. 
- **Safety and Security** prevent hacking of smart-contracts and leakage of user funds.
- **Clarity** allows us to make sure that the smart-contract is secure developer has not added his malicious code there.
- **Approachability** The fact that Cadence is very similar to other programming languages makes it easy for many developers to go to Flow and start building.
- **Developer Experience** allows developers to quickly find bugs and fix them.
